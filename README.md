This repository contains the code and queries of Group 5's capstone project looking into the effects of weather at certain airports. We started by utilizing the data in previous assignments of the class such as the 2022 flight data. In addition to this, we used weather.api to pull active data from 4 major airports, O'Hare, LAX, JFK, and Atlanta. We also collected archived weather data from 2022 of weather conditions in the same airport. Using the archived weather data and the flight data from 2022, we constructed a machine learning model to predict whether a flight would be delayed depending on certain atmospheric conditions. This model coud then be paired to the weather.api data in order to have the model generate the likelihood that a flight to any of these given airports might be delayed based on current conditions.
